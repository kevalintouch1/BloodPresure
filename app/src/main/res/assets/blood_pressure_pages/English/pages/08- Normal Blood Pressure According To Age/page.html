<h3>Normal Blood Pressure According To Age</h3>
<p>The force exerted on the inner side of arteries by the blood is called blood pressure. To measure blood pressure, a sphygmomanometer is used (also known as a blood pressure cuff). The cuff is bound around your upper arm and expanded (swollen) to suppress blood movement in the arteries. </p>
<p>When we measure blood pressure, we obtain two numbers. One is systolic blood pressure, and the other is diastolic blood pressure. The former causes blood squeezing to the rest of the body through arteries. This results in pressure on the blood vessels. The latter cause the exertion of force when the heart rests between beats in the arteries. Blood and oxygen are filled in the heart at diastolic pressure. </p>
<p>Normal blood pressure remains the same for a person. Insignificant fluctuation due to relaxation or stress may occur throughout the day. Usually, normal systolic blood pressure is 120 mm Hg, and normal diastolic blood pressure is 80 mm Hg. </p>
<h2>Normal Blood Pressure for Children: </h2>
<p> The average or normal blood pressure range in children shows variation. Normal blood pressure varies based on height, age, and sex of the children. The University of Iowa stead family children’s hospital provides the following normal range information: </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>• Newborn Babies: 60 to 90 mm Hg (systolic), 20 to 60 mm Hg (diastolic) </strong></p>
<p><strong>• Infant: 87 to 105 mm Hg (systolic), 53 to 66 mm Hg (diastolic) </strong></p>
<p><strong>• Toddler: 95 to 105 mm Hg (systolic), 53 to 66 mmHg (diastolic) </strong></p>
<p><strong>• Preschooler: 95 to 110 mm Hg (systolic),56 to 70 mm Hg (diastolic) </strong></p>
<p><strong>• School-aged child: 97 to 112 mm Hg (systolic), 57 to 71 mm Hg (diastolic) </strong></p>
<p><strong>• Adolescent: 112 to 128 mm Hg (systolic), 66 to 80 mm Hg (diastolic) </strong></p>
<h2>Normal Blood Pressure for Adults: </h2>
<p> The average blood pressure range for adults (ages 20 or more) is about 120/80 mm Hg or below. </p>
<h3>Normal Blood Pressure by Age: </h3>
<p><strong> With time, your blood vessels become stiff, and plaque (a fatty material) may develop in them. As a result, blood pressure rises to its average value. If you have too much high blood pressure, you are more likely to acquire cardiovascular diseases or stroke.</strong><br>
</p>
<p>National Centre for Health Statistics provides the following data regarding normal blood pressure values: </p>
<h2>For Males: </h2>
<p><strong> • For 21 to 25 age: 120 mm Hg (systolic),78 mm Hg (diastolic) </strong></p>
<p><strong>• For 26 to 30 age: 119 mmHg (systolic), 76 mm Hg (diastolic) </strong></p>
<p><strong>• For 31 to 40 age: 114 mm Hg (systolic), 75 mm Hg (diastolic) </strong></p>
<p><strong>• For 41 to 50 age: 115 mm Hg (systolic), 80 mm Hg (diastolic) </strong></p>
<p><strong>• For 51 to 60 age: 125 mm Hg (systolic), 79 mm Hg (diastolic) </strong></p>
<h2>For Females: </h2>
<p><strong> • For 21 to 30 age: 115 mm Hg (systolic), 71 mm Hg (diastolic) </strong></p>
<p><strong>• For 31 to 40 age: 110 mm Hg (systolic), 74 mm Hg (diastolic) </strong></p>
<p><strong>• For 41 to 50 age: 116 mm Hg (systolic), 78 mm Hg (diastolic) </strong></p>
<p><strong>• For 51 to 60 age: 122 mm Hg (systolic), 77 mm Hg (diastolic) </strong></p>
<h3>What Is High Blood Pressure ? </h3>
<p> High blood pressure is becoming more common nowadays. In 1972, the national heart, lung, and blood institute proposed the National High Blood Pressure Education Program. This developed awareness in the people about high blood pressure, its causes, prevention, etc. </p>
<h2>Symptoms of high blood pressure are: </h2>
<p><strong> • Nosebleed </strong></p>
<p><strong>• Severe headaches </strong></p>
<p><strong>• Confusion or fatigue </strong></p>
<p><strong>• Irregular heartbeat </strong></p>
<p><strong>• Chest pain </strong></p>
<p><strong>• Difficulty in breathing </strong></p>
<p><strong>• Blood in the urine </strong></p>
<p><strong> Exercises regularly and lifestyle changes can assist in dealing with high blood pressure. Some of the changes can include: </strong><br>
</p>
<p><strong>• Quit smoking </strong></p>
<p><strong>• Avoid alcohol or limit the intake. </strong></p>
<p><strong>• Follow low sodium and a low-fat diet. </strong></p>
<p><strong>• Don’t take too much stress. </strong></p>
<p><strong>• Weight loss • Cut back on caffeine. </strong></p>
<p><strong>• Take food rich in calcium, magnesium, and potassium like milk and banana. </strong></p>
<p><strong>• After the age of 35 years, check the blood pressure regularly. </strong></p>
<h2>Risk Factors: </h2>
<p><strong> Major risk factors of having high blood pressure are explained below:</strong></p>
<h4>1. Unbalanced diet :</h4>
<p> foods containing high amounts of salt, saturated fats, and sugar leads to high blood pressure. So, consequently, you are more likely to adopt cardiovascular disorders, stroke, or more.</p>
<h4>2. Little or no exercise : </h4>
<p> workout or exercises assist your body to burn body fat and prevent the accumulation of extra salts, water, and other useless substances. People who do not work out are at a greater risk of blood pressure issues, hypertension, or heart syndromes. </p>
<h4>3. Smoking : </h4>
<p> arteries or veins can be damaged by smoking tobacco or being exposed to secondhand smoke. Consequently, blood pressure may rise.</p>
<h4>4. Obesity : </h4>
<p> in obesity, fat is accumulated in the arteries, which produce resistance in the way of oxygen and blood through the body.</p>
<h4>5. Sex and age : </h4>
<p> people are more likely to acquire high blood pressure by age. But men are at greater risk of the abnormal blood pressure range.</p>
<h4>6. Family History : </h4>
<p> hypertension tends to run in families (generation after generation). If your grandparents or your father or mother have had hypertension, you might suffer from it too.</p>
<h3>How to Maintain Normal Blood Pressure by Age? </h3>
<p><strong> It is essential to maintain blood pressure by age to prevent lethal diseases. In this respect, the following key points may assist you:</strong></p>
<h4>1. Take Proper Meal: </h4>
<p> read the food labels to check the sodium quantity. Concern your doctor and ask him what should be the daily sodium limit. Also, include fruits and vegetables in your diet.</p>
<h4>2. Exercise or workout: </h4>
<p> Workouts should be done on a regular basis. It will make you physically fit, and the risk of cardiovascular diseases will also be minimized. </p>
<h4>3. Avoid smoking and alcohol: </h4>
<p> make sure that your diet should be alcohol-free. And also prevent smoking. As they both cause disturbance in your blood pressure range.</p>
<h4>4. Healthy Body Weight: </h4>
<p> obesity also elevates your blood pressure. If you are not sure what a healthy weight would be for you, concern your doctor. He will tell you according to body mass index (BMI).</p>
<h4>5. Avoid stress or depression:</h4>
<p> it is a major cause due to which people are experiencing variation in blood pressure. Anxiety or depression creates an emergency in the body that leads to increased blood pressure.</p>
