<h3>10 Effective Ways To Control High Blood Pressure Without Drugs </h3>
<p>High blood pressure (also hypertension) is a very common disease nowadays. Almost everybody next to you is suffering from high blood pressure, whether it is a male, female, young, old, or even teenager. But early high blood pressure is not such a disease that you would need medication to cure; you can easily control it without medicines by following a good strategy. </p>
<h3>How can you control your blood pressure without drugs ? </h3>
<p><strong> You can control high blood pressure easily by modifying your lifestyle. There are the following methods to control high blood pressure or hypertension without using drugs:</strong><br>
</p>
<h4>1. Decreased Dietary Salt (Sodium) Intake </h4>
<h4>2. Increased Dietary Potassium intake </h4>
<h4>3. Exercise Regularly </h4>
<h4>4. Weight Loss </h4>
<h4>5. Eat a Healthy Diet </h4>
<h4>6. Smoking Cessation </h4>
<h4>7. Reducing Alcohol Consumption </h4>
<h4>8. Relaxation Therapy </h4>
<h4>9. Reduce Stress </h4>
<h4>10. Monitor Blood Pressure Regularly </h4>
<p><strong> Let's discuss them one by one in detail : </strong></p>
<h2>Decreased Salt (Sodium) Intake </h2>
<p>The World Health Organisation (WHO) recommends that an adult person should not eat more than 5g of salt per day. Eating excessive salt is not good for our health. If you use excess salt, it will cause water retention in the body through the kidneys. Excess water goes to the blood vessels and causes an increase in blood pressure. Decreased salt intake causes increased water filtration through kidneys, and blood pressure remains normal or lower. So, salt must be used in adequate quantities to avoid Blood Pressure Problems.</p>
<p>Even a Small Reduction of Sodium or salt in the diet improves the health of the heart &amp; decreases Blood Pressure. </p>
<h2>Increased Dietary Potassium intake </h2>
<p>Supplements which are rich in Potassium are very helpful in the management of High Blood Pressure. Potassium-rich supplements are bananas, leafy greens, potatoes, apricots, avocados, oranges, tomatoes &amp; spinach. </p>
<h4>• Potassium Decreases the effects of Sodium. </h4>
<h4>• If we eat more Potassium, it means we are losing Sodium through kidneys, which decreases Blood Pressure. </h4>
<h4>• Potassium also plays an essential role in releasing the tension in the walls of blood vessels, which helps lower blood pressure. </h4>
<h2>Exercise Regularly </h2>
<p><strong> Regular Physical activities, i.e., brisk walking and aerobic exercise for 25 to 30 minutes daily, helps in lowering blood pressure and other cardiovascular diseases.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Aerobic exercise means that exercise increases the heart rate and breathing rate; it includes : </strong></p>
<h4>• Active sports, such as basketball or tennis </h4>
<h4>• Bicycling </h4>
<h4>• Climbing stairs </h4>
<h4>• Jogging </h4>
<h4>• Swimming </h4>
<h4>• Walking </h4>
<p> Regular exercise also makes your heart stronger. A healthy and stronger heart can pump more blood with less effort, decreasing the force on arterial blood vessels eventually lowering blood pressure.</p>
<p>Only a single bout of aerobic exercise causes the acute reduction of blood pressure—this phenomenon is known as Post Exercise Hypotension. </p>
<h2>Weight Loss </h2>
<p> Body Weight (BW) is directly related to blood pressure. Increased Body Weight (IBW) is the essential leading risk factor for developing hypertension. In order to cope with hypertension, one must have to keep Body Mass Index (BMI) within the normal range of 18.5-24.9. The following formula can calculate BMI; </p>
<h4>BMI = weight (kg) / [height (m×m)] </h4>
<h4>• A person having a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 25 to 29.9 is considered Overweight. </h4>
<h4>• A person having a Body Mass Index of 30 or more is considered Obese. </h4>
<h4>• Being Overweight or Obese increases the risk of high blood pressure. Losing bodyweight even 10 pounds (4.6Kg) also decreases blood pressure. </h4>
<h4>• If you lose more body weight, it means you are lowering more blood pressure. </h4>
<p> "Weight loss is an effective and non-pharmacological method for the prevention of hypertension."</p>
<h2>Eat Healthy Diet </h2>
<p> Eating a healthy diet is also essential for lowering blood pressure. There is a particular diet plan for patients with hypertension known as DASH Diet (Dietary Approaches to Stop hypertension).</p>
<h2>Dash Diet Plan</h2>
<p><strong> A well-balanced diet, i.e., rich in fruits, vegetables, grains, nuts, and low-fat dairy foods.</strong></p>
<h4>• Fruits, e.g., pomegranate, strawberry, banana </h4>
<h4>• Vegetables, e.g., Sweet potatoes, carrots, cabbage, cucumber </h4>
<h4>• Grains, e.g., Popcorn, Brown Rice, wheat pasta • Nuts, e.g., almonds, pistachios, walnuts </h4>
<h4>• Low-Fat Dairy Foods, e.g., yogurt, cheese, fish, steaks </h4>
<h2>Smoking or using tobacco : </h2>
<p><strong> Smoking is the major risk factor for high blood pressure and other cardiovascular diseases. Nicotine in cigarettes is very lethal. Nicotine has the following effects :</strong></p>
<h4>• Release of Local &amp; Systemic Catecholamines </h4>
<h4>• Release of Vasopressin </h4>
<h4>• Smoking causes the hardening and narrowing of arteries, which eventually leads to an increase in Blood Pressure. </h4>
<h4>• Smoking damages the blood vessels and causes inflammation which leads to plaque formation. Plaque causes cardiovascular diseases like heart attack, atherosclerosis &amp; stroke. </h4>
<h4>• Smoking-induced hypertension can be treated only by quitting smoking. After quitting smoking, blood pressure returns to normal levels. </h4>

<h2>Reducing Alcohol Consumption </h2>
<p><strong> Excessive Alcohol intake causes hypertension. Alcohol affects blood pressure in the following ways :</strong></p>
<h2>Renin-Angiotensin System </h2>
<p> Alcohol interferes with the liver's normal function; the liver can't metabolize renin &amp; angiotensin, the most crucial blood pressure regulators. It means consuming excessive alcohol increases the concentration of renin in the blood. Renin causes constriction of blood vessels and fluid retention. Thus, it ultimately leads to an increase in blood pressure.</p>
<h2>Blood Calcium levels</h2>
<p> Excessive consumption of alcohol increases blood calcium levels. Muscles require calcium for their contraction. More calcium means more constriction of vascular smooth muscles, which leads to an increase in blood pressure.</p>
<h2>Blood Magnesium Levels</h2>
<p> Excessive consumption of alcohol reduces the levels of Magnesium in blood. Magnesium affects blood pressure by maintaining vascular tone. Magnesium has vasodilating action; no magnesium means no vasodilation, resulting in increased blood pressure. </p>
<p>Drinking too much alcohol is lethal. One should limit the use of alcohol to one or two drinks per day or quit drinking permanently to prevent hypertension.</p>
<h2>Relaxation Therapy </h2>
<p><strong> There are different relaxation therapies like : </strong></p>
<h4>• yoga </h4>
<h4>• meditation </h4>
<h4>• deep breathing </h4>
<p><strong> These relaxation techniques cause the formation of a few compounds, which opens the constricted blood vessels. Thus, lowering the blood pressure.</strong><br>
</p>
<p><strong> Benefits of relaxation techniques other than lowering blood pressure are: </strong></p>
<h4>• relieve pain </h4>
<h4>• improve sleep </h4>
<h4>• reduces migraine attack </h4>
<h4>• reduces physical mental stress </h4>
<h2>Reduce Stress </h2>
<p>Stress is directly related to hypertension. There is a production of a surge of hormones when a person experiences stressful situations or events. These hormones have the following effects: </p>
<h4>• increased heartbeat </h4>
<h4>• narrowing of blood vessels </h4>
<p><strong>So, it ultimately increases blood pressure. Stress-reducing activities may help lower blood pressure like: </strong></p>
<h4>• Progressive muscle relaxation techniques </h4>
<h4>• yoga </h4>
<h4>• meditation </h4>
<h4>• deep breathing </h4>
<p><strong> It helps in reducing stress and blood pressure as well. </strong></p>
<h2>Monitor Blood Pressure Regularly </h2>
<p><strong> Monitoring of blood pressure in a home on a daily basis helps in the detection of cardiovascular risks, stroke &amp; other health conditions. </strong></p>
