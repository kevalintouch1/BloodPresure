<h3>Causes Of High And Low Blood Pressure</h3>
<p>The heart pumps the blood throughout your whole body. Blood is pumped into the blood vessels and then to the entire body. To keep yourself healthy, you should maintain your blood pressure because your health depends on how much you maintain your blood pressure. Your body organs like the heart, kidneys, brain, and stomach only usually function when your body's blood pressure is normal. </p>
<h2>Normal Blood Pressure: </h2>
<p> Normal blood pressure is 120/80. The upper value is systolic blood pressure, and the lower one is diastolic blood pressure. Below 120/80 is low blood pressure, and above is high. You are supposed to maintain your blood pressure by several precautionary measures. </p>
<h2>Hypertension </h2>
<p> Hypertension is another name for high blood pressure. In this condition, arteries are hardened, making it hard for blood to work smoothly. The hardening of arteries is called atherosclerosis. High blood pressure leads to kidney diseases, stroke, or even heart failure. Several factors cause high blood pressure. </p>
<h3>Causes Of High Blood Pressure: </h3>
<p><strong> There may be many causes of hypertension or high blood pressure. Some are mentioned below: </strong><br>
</p>
<p><strong>• Stress </strong></p>
<p><strong>• Increasing age </strong></p>
<p><strong>• Hereditary; runs in the family </strong></p>
<p><strong>• Sleep apnea </strong></p>
<p><strong>• Thyroid and adrenal disorders </strong></p>
<p><strong>• More sodium intake </strong></p>
<p><strong>• Obesity </strong></p>
<p><strong>• Smoking </strong></p>
<p><strong>• Alcohol consumption </strong></p>
<p><strong>• Kidney disease </strong></p>
<p>These are the predicted factors that result in hypertension. </p>
<h2>Stress: </h2>
<p> When you are in a stressful condition, surges of hormones are secreted by your body. Your heart starts to beat faster, and your blood vessels are narrowed. This causes high blood pressure. In the beginning, stress affects your blood pressure a little. With time it increases and causes a heart attack or stroke all of a sudden. </p>
<h2>Increasing Age: </h2>
<p> Age and race are the most common causes of high blood pressure. When men and women cross-age 50, they are more likely to develop hypertension. They have to take medicines daily. They need to check their blood pressure every day. At 50 or more, there are higher chances of heart attack or stroke. So people of an older age need to be more responsible and careful about their health. Even minor negligence can result in serious trouble. </p>
<h2>Genetics: </h2>
<p> High blood pressure runs in the family as it is hereditary. You receive it from your parents or grandparents. If you are well aware of this problem, you must take precautionary measures from the beginning. It would help if you took a good diet and took medicines under the doctor's prescription. </p>
<h2>Race: </h2>
<p> This is not included in many causes of hypertension, but it can be one of the reasons. Recently in America, it has been analyzed that blacks are affected with hypertension more than whites. After 65, there is a greater chance of high blood pressure in black women. </p>
<h2>Sleep apnea: </h2>
<p> Sleep apnea is very dangerous. It forces the brain to pump more blood to the heart and brain. As a result, it pressurized the artery wall and caused high blood pressure. When you are sleeping, you don't even know what is happening. It will help if you communicate with your doctor. </p>
<h2>Salt intake: </h2>
<p> The relation between high blood pressure and salt is noticeable. The best example is of people living in Japan. The people of the northern island of Japan consume more salt than any other area or country of the world. Therefore, they are suffering from hypertension. Some people are sensitive to salt, which means minor salt intake can increase their blood pressure.</p>
<p> Firstly, we should avoid taking a lot of packed food, and you should also avoid the food market because it is also full of salt. When you automatically reduce sodium uptake, your blood pressure will be normal. </p>
<h2>Obesity: </h2>
<p> Obesity is the mother of all diseases: increased fat causes high blood pressure. More fat accumulation compresses the kidney and ultimately causes hypertension. High blood pressure leads to chronic kidney diseases, and the person suffers a lifetime of pain. So try to maintain your diet and do healthy exercise to lose weight. You can lose weight by doing exercise regularly.</p>
<h2>Smoking and alcohol consumption: </h2>
<p><strong> The overuse of alcohol tends to have hypertension 1.5 - 2 times more than an average person. The difference is prominent when one has more than five drinks a day. Hypertension is directly proportional to the usage of alcohol. </strong></p>
<h2>Being Overweight:</h2>
<p> If you are overweight, more blood you would need to supply nutrients and oxygen to your tissues. And as the amount of blood flow through your vessels increases, the pressure on your artery walls will also increase considerably. </p>
<p>Smoking may cause other diseases related to the heart, but it's not directly linked with hypertension. However, repetition of cigarettes may result in a quick and temporary high blood pressure. </p>
<h2>Low Blood Pressure</h2>
<p> Blood pressure less than 90 mmHg systolic and 60 mmHg diastolic is considered low blood pressure or hypotension. Severe low blood pressure can be life-threatening. </p>
<h3>Causes of Low Blood Pressure: </h3>
<p><strong> There may be many causes of low blood pressure as: </strong></p>
<h2>Pregnancy</h2>
<p> Pregnancy is the leading cause of low blood pressure. When a woman is pregnant, her whole circulatory system expands, and the blood has to circulate in the baby's body too. Hence, the blood pressure drops from normal. When the blood pressure is low, you feel dizzy, but after the child's birth, the blood pressure becomes normal. </p>
<h2>Dehydration </h2>
<p> When a person does not take a sufficient amount of water, the system of our body fails to function normally; and results in low blood volume and low blood pressure. When your body is not working, it will cause a lot of diseases like dizziness, vomiting, and many other health issues. </p>
<h2>Lack of nutrients in your diet </h2>
<p> When you do not take a proper amount of nutrients, it's clear that your blood pressure will drop from average. The lack of sodium (salt) in our diet is the leading cause of low blood pressure. Nutrients are essential for your body, and salt intake is crucial to maintain your blood pressure. </p>
<h2>Severe infections and blood loss </h2>
<p> A lot of infections can be a sign of low blood pressure. Any infection in your body, like infection in the stomach or gastrointestinal tract, will cause a decrease in blood pressure. When the blood is lost from your body due to severe injuries like hemorrhage, your blood level will decrease from normal and cause severe hypotension. </p>
<h3>The bottom line: </h3>
<p><strong> These all are the causes of hypertension and hypotension. Hypertension can destroy your health adversely. A sudden rise in blood pressure can cause a heart attack or stroke. Nosebleeds save you from massive downfall. </strong></p>
<p>You should check your blood pressure regularly if you are an older adult. If you are a patient with hypertension, you should take medicines regularly. Hoping all your queries regarding the causes of high and low blood pressure are explicit </p>
