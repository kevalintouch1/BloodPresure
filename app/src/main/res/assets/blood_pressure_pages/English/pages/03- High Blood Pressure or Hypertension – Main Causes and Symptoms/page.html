<h3>High Blood Pressure or Hypertension – Main Causes and Symptoms </h3>
<p>Hypertension is a condition in which blood is forced for a long time against artery walls. The arteries get narrower when your heart pumps excessive blood and causes high blood pressure. If your blood pressure stays elevated above the normal range, you might have hypertension. You can suffer from high blood pressure without any symptoms, and you might get to know about it when it gets severe. However, high blood pressure can be detected in many ways. </p>
<p><strong>The blood pressure reading has two numbers as mentioned below: </strong></p>
<h2>Systolic Pressure: </h2>
<p> It estimates the blood pressure while your heart is beating. The normal Systolic blood pressure is 120 mmHg. </p>
<h2>Diastolic Pressure: </h2>
<p> It estimates the blood pressure between the heartbeats. The normal Diastolic blood pressure is 80 mmHg. </p>
<h3>Symptoms of high blood pressure or hypertension: </h3>
<p><strong> Some people suffer from high blood pressure without knowing it. They don't notice any visible signs or symptoms even if their life is in danger. When blood reaches a high level, some symptoms may appear. The person may suffer from severe headaches, nosebleeds, and even shortness of breath. Unfortunately, these symptoms are identified when high blood pressure becomes life-threatening.</strong><br>
</p>
<p><strong>Some of the common and most prevalent symptoms of hypertension are: </strong></p>
<p><strong>• Severe headache </strong></p>
<p><strong>• Chest pain </strong></p>
<p><strong>• Nosebleed </strong></p>
<p><strong>• Shortness of breath or apnea </strong></p>
<p><strong>• Irregular heartbeats </strong></p>
<p><strong>• Vision problem </strong></p>
<p><strong>• Blood in the urine </strong></p>
<p><strong>• Confusion or fatigue </strong></p>
<h2>Visit a doctor: </h2>
<p> You should visit a doctor if you feel any pain or irregularity in your health. If your age is 18, you must see a doctor twice a year to measure your blood pressure. If you are above your 40s, you must check your blood pressure daily. </p>
<p>If you want to know the difference, you should check blood pressure in both arms, but use an appropriate-sized arm cuff. If you have risks of cardiovascular diseases, your doctor will recommend you to take a frequent reading of blood pressure every day. If visiting the doctor every day is not convenient, you can have free blood pressure screening at the nearest location of healthcare center resources. </p>
<p>Another easy way to measure your blood pressure regularly is to buy a blood pressure measuring machine to check your blood pressure at home easily. Those machines will not give accurate results unless you follow the instructions. You should consider some factors while measuring your blood pressure; for example, cuff size must be precise or simply ask your doctor to guide you well. </p>
<h3>Types of Hypertension: </h3>
<p> There are two types of hypertension: </p>
<p>1. Primary hypertension </p>
<p>2. Secondary hypertension </p>
<h2>Primary hypertension: </h2>
<p><strong> It develops gradually as age increases. In this hypertension, there are no visible symptoms of high blood pressure. There is no specific cause of primary hypertension.</strong></p>
<h2>Secondary hypertension:</h2>
<p> There can be an invisible or visible cause of high blood pressure in secondary hypertension. Some conditions can lead to secondary hypertension as:</p>
<p><strong>• Kidney diseases </strong></p>
<p><strong>• Drugs such as cocaine </strong></p>
<p><strong>• Thyroid problems </strong></p>
<p><strong>• Obstructive sleep apnea </strong></p>
<p><strong>• Adrenal gland tumors </strong></p>
<h3>Causes of Hypertension: </h3>
<p><strong> There can be many known or unknown causes of high blood pressure. Some of the common of hypertension can be: </strong></p>
<h4>Age : </h4>
<p> Age is one of the risk factors which causes high blood pressure. It is common in men until the age of 64, while in women, it develops after 65. Nowadays, an imbalance in the diet affects people's blood pressure at an early age. Even youngsters are suffering from high blood pressure. This is all because of stress and an unhealthy diet.</p>
<h4>Family History : </h4>
<p> Hypertension can be a hereditary disease. It runs in the family. If someone's father, mother, or grandparents suffered from hypertension, they might suffer too.</p>
<h4>Race : </h4>
<p> High blood pressure is standard in African heritage. Africans usually suffer from stroke, kidney failure, and heart attacks at an early age.</p>
<h4>Being obese :</h4>
<p> The greater you weigh, the more blood you need to circulate to deliver appropriate oxygen and nutrients to your tissues. And many other factors of being overweight lead to chronic high pressure.</p>
<h4>Being inactive : </h4>
<p><strong> If you are not being bodily active or lively, you can develop hypertension. Inactive people tend to have more coronary heart diseases. Total lack of walking or exercising can lead to severe hypertension and other health hazards. Moreover, the lack of exercise can also increase the risk of being obese.</strong></p>
<h4>Smoking or using tobacco : </h4>
<p> The hazardous chemical compounds in tobacco cannot only cause lung cancer but can also damage the lining of your artery walls. This can make your arteries rigid, which ultimately increases the danger of coronary heart illness and many other diseases.</p>
<h4>Excessive salt or sodium intake : </h4>
<p> Excessive sodium intake for your weight loss program can cause your body to retain excess fluid, increasing your blood volume and, ultimately, blood pressure. </p>
<h4>Low potassium intake : </h4>
<p> Too low potassium in your diet can lead to high blood pressure. Potassium permits the stability of the quantity of sodium for your cells. A proper balance of potassium is crucial for appropriate coronary heart health. If you do not take enough potassium for your diet, sodium can boost your blood volume and pressure.</p>
<h4>Drinking too much alcohol : </h4>
<p> Over time, heavy drinking can harm your coronary heart health. Having a couple of drinks in the afternoon for women and more beverages a day for men can significantly affect your blood pressure.</p>
<h4>Stress :</h4>
<p> Stress is the most prominent cause of high blood pressure diseases. Stress is considered the most prevalent cause of hypertension nowadays.</p>
<h4>Treatment :</h4>
<p> If you have hypertension, you must visit the doctor and take proper medicines as prescribed by your doctor. You must follow the suggestions mentioned above to control your blood pressure. Do exercise daily, try to stay stress-free, and avoid unhealthy food if you are really concerned about your health. Most importantly, quit smoking to save your life if you are a smoker. </p>
<h4>Conclusion : </h4>
<p> High blood pressure can be fatal and life-threatening. It would be helpful if you took care of your health properly. Try not to take the stress as it is a major cause of hypertension. Daily exercise and a suitable diet will be very beneficial for maintaining your health. So, if you want to stay healthy, adopt a healthy lifestyle today! </p>
