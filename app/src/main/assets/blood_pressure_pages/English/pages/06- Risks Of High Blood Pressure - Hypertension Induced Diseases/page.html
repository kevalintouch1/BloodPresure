<h3>Risks Of High Blood Pressure - Hypertension Induced Diseases </h3>
<p>if your blood pressure is very high, it stresses your circulatory system and organs. Your risk for complications such as cardiovascular diseases like heart attack, stroke, kidney failure, and blindness increases dramatically. </p>
<p>If you have prolonged high blood pressure or hypertension, lowering it by even a little bit can help decrease the risk of cardiovascular diseases and stroke. To combat this, you should eat more fruits, vegetables, fish (particularly fatty fish such as salmon), nuts, whole grains, and beans. Also, try to get regular exercise to help lower your blood pressure. One thing that is sometimes overlooked for lowering blood pressure is reducing stress. So, keep breathing slowly and deeply, directly impacting your heart rate. </p>
<p>Prolonged High blood pressure (or hypertension) is when the force of blood against the walls of your arteries is higher than usual. This could place extra pressure on your heart, forcing it to work harder to pump blood throughout the body. Since it takes some serious muscle strength to keep up with this over-exercised organ, it's not surprising that a thickened left ventricle will increase the chance of a heart attack, heart failure, and sudden cardiac death. </p>
<h3>Things That Increase Risks Of Developing High Blood Pressure </h3>
<p><strong> The risk of developing high blood pressure typically depends on one's genetics, lifestyle factors, and even the way their body handles calcium. High blood pressure may be a hereditary condition. Thus, your family history may risk becoming pre-hypertensive or hypertensive. However, one can make many lifestyle changes to reduce their risk. Suppose you find yourself with elevated blood pressure. </strong></p>
<p><strong>In that case, your doctor may recommend various lifestyle modifications that could help bring it down, ranging from adjusting your diet to getting more exercise every day.</strong><br>
</p>
<h3>Hypertension and Cardiovascular Diseases </h3>
<p>Prolonged hypertension can lead to many severe cardiovascular diseases and increase your heart attack or stroke risk. Some hypertension-induced diseases are:</p>
<h2>Heart failure </h2>
<p> Over time, constant strain on the heart caused by high blood pressure can make a person's heart become weakened and start working less efficiently. Eventually, the overwhelmed heart fails altogether in instances of congestive heart failure. </p>
<h2>Aneurysm </h2>
<p>An aneurysm (also spelled aneurism) is a widening of the wall of an artery due to weakness in that section of its wall. An aneurysm can cause life-threatening internal bleeding. Aneurysms most commonly manifest as a bulge or swelling on the wall of the affected artery, but they may also present with narrowing of the artery's area, tenting where the walls are pulled apart like a circus tent or even incomplete closure following trauma.</p>
<p> Aneurysms can occur in any blood vessel, including those servicing the heart and brain, but they are most common in the body's largest artery - the aorta. </p>
<h2>Kidney failure </h2>
<p>High blood pressure is one of the leading reasons behind kidney failure. High blood pressure damages the blood vessels in the nephrotic tissue, which no longer effectively filters waste from the blood, allowing dangerous fluid and debris to collect in the body. Treatment options include dialysis or kidney transplantation. </p>
<h2>Kidney scarring </h2>
<p><strong> A damaged kidney is a type of kidney damage that occurs when small vessels in the nephrotic tissue become scarred and can no longer filter waste from the blood effectively. Glomerulosclerosis can lead to kidney failure.</strong></p>
<h2>Damaged and narrowed arteries</h2>
<p> High blood pressure can cause many heart diseases and strokes, the leading causes of death among people with hypertension. High blood pressure damages arteries, affecting the arteries' elasticity, decreasing blood flow throughout the body.</p>
<h2>Coronary artery disease </h2>
<p><strong> Because of high blood pressure, damaged blood vessels have trouble providing enough blood supply to the heart. The heart, responsible for pumping oxygen-rich blood around your body, can't pump as much when not enough blood vessels can get it there. This can lead to chest pain, irregular heart rhythms, and a heart attack if things go badly. </strong></p>
<h2>Stroke </h2>
<p> Brain cells do not get enough nutrients and oxygen when a stroke occurs. A neurological disorder is the most common cause of a stroke, but it can also be caused by the rupture or leaking of blood vessels. High blood pressure can play a role in both forms of stroke, as it can narrow or break blood vessels or cause blood clots to form.</p>
<h2>Dementia </h2>
<p> Blocked or narrowed blood vessels in the heart, brain (cerebrovascular), or neck (carotid artery) can lead to damage within that specific area. This damage can eventually result in vascular dementia. It can also be caused by a stroke that interrupts blood flow to the brain.</p>
<h2>Sexual dysfunction </h2>
<p> Erectile dysfunction is when one has difficulty getting or sustaining an erection. Males who are 50 years old will start to experience bouts of erectile dysfunction, and it becomes even more common as they age, but there is a connection between sexual problems and pressure.</p>
<p> Sexual issues arise because some blockage occurs: a limited blood flow, at least this is what happens with high blood pressure; blocked off blood vessels to the sexual organs, thus making it difficult for the male to get or sustain an erection. Women may suffer from sexual problems when having high blood pressure as well.</p>
<h3>How Does Hypertension Impair Kidney Functions ?</h3>
<p> Sometimes when one's circulatory system is compromised somehow, the function of their kidneys will also suffer as a consequence. The urinary system, which is accountable for filtering waste products from our blood, relies on the cardiovascular system to provide enough oxygen and nutrients at all times. </p>
<p>Blood pressure often puts undue strain on the heart and most commonly results in excessive stress being put on the irreplaceable vascular system.</p>
<h3>Blood Pressure And Heart Attacks </h3>
<p><strong> High blood pressure is exactly as it suggests: your blood pressure is higher than usual and can often cause concern. This is because it dictates how much the heart has to work to send the blood around the body via the arteries (the network of which branches out all over to help push the flow).</strong></p>
<p>Excess fats, cholesterol, and more build up in these pathways over time, and this could slow down your blood flow if you didn't realize that that wasn't supposed to be happening, right?! The narrowing means that it takes more pressure - aka force - for your heart to pump correctly through these tubes. In return, plaque builds up over time and turns into a solid coat on the inside walls of your arteries, then breaks off into either smaller "flaky" pieces or one big clump that we call a "blood clot." The latter interrupts the normal flow, and this is when we say there's been a "heart attack" or a myocardial infarction. </p>
