<h3>How Your Lifestyle Can Affect Your Blood Pressure </h3>
<p><strong>Blood pressure is the force of blood pushing against the walls of your arteries. It is essential to know your blood pressure because high blood pressure, or hypertension, can increase your chances of myocardial infarction (heart attack), stroke, and other serious health problems. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Several factors can affect your blood pressure. The lifestyle you live may be one of them. Factors that may increase the chances of high blood pressure (Hypertension) include being overweight (obese), smoking cigarettes, drinking alcohol considerably heavily, and not exercising enough. Eating a healthy diet and exercising habitually are two ways to help control your blood pressure. </strong></p>
<h3>What Is Blood Pressure ? </h3>
<p> When your heart beats, blood travels from your heart to your body and is pumped into the blood vessels to meet your body's demand. Usually, we refer to arterial blood pressure when we say blood pressure. The pressure of blood in the arteries in one cardiac cycle or heartbeat is called arterial blood pressure. </p>
<h4>• The normal systolic pressure is about 120 mmHg, and the diastolic pressure is about 80 mmHg, and therefore the arterial pressure is said to be 120\80. </h4>
<h2>High blood pressure: </h2>
<p><strong> Blood pressure more than the normal values is called high blood pressure. But it is not necessary that you must have hypertension if you've high blood pressure. But if your blood pressure stays more than 120\80 continuously, it can lead to hypertension.</strong><br>
</p>
<p><strong>People with really high blood pressure have more than one of the following problems : </strong></p>
<h4>• Congestive heart failure (CHF). </h4>
<h4>• Enlarged or bulging vessels, causing the arteries to narrow. </h4>
<h4>• Pregnancy. </h4>
<h4>• Hypertension (high blood pressure). </h4>
<h4>• Inflammation. </h4>
<h2>What causes blood pressure to rise? </h2>
<p><strong> What you usually eat and what you don't eat are essential for keeping blood pressure down. Factors that may cause blood pressure to rise are your diet, lifestyle, and stress level.

<h4>• Emotional stress • Lifestyle </h4>
<h4>• Serious medical conditions </h4>
<p> People with chronic illnesses, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), can also be at risk of hypertension. Sometimes the nerve present in the patient's nose cannot bear the high blood pressure. As a result, it starts bleeding. The nose bleeds for hours continuously. It is not bad because it saves a patient from a heart attack or stroke. </p>
