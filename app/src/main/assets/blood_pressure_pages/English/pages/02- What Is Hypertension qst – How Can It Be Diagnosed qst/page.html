<h3>What Is Hypertension ? – How Can It Be Diagnosed ? </h3>
<p>Hypertension or high blood pressure is such a condition in which the force exerted by blood against the artery walls is too high. Blood pressure is controlled by the amount of resistance to blood flow in the arteries and the amount of blood the heart pumps. The narrower the arteries, the more blood the heart pumps, the higher blood pressure will be. Long-term hypertension leads to complications through atherosclerosis. Hypertension-associated atherosclerosis can cause stroke, heart failure and heart attack, amputation, kidney failure, aneurysm, or a typical bulge in the artery walls that can burst. </p>
<p> Hypertension is measured by an instrument known as a sphygmomanometer. And reading obtained is in millimeters of mercury (mm Hg). When we measure blood pressure by a sphygmomanometer, we get two numbers: </p>
<h2>Systolic blood pressure:</h2>
<p> It is the top number that measures the force in the arteries when the heartbeats. The normal systolic pressure value is 120 mmHg. </p>
<h2>Diastolic Blood Pressure: </h2>
<p> It is the bottom number that measures the force in the arteries between beats. The normal diastolic pressure value is 80 mmHg. </p>
<h3>Types of Hypertension: </h3>
<p><strong> There are two major types of hypertension: </strong></p>
<h2>Primary Hypertension: </h2>
<p> In primary hypertension, blood pressure develops steadily over many years. Causes of this type are not as such identifiable. People do not feel any severe complications or health issues in this type of hypertension. </p>
<h2>Secondary Hypertension: </h2>
<p> In secondary hypertension, blood pressure appears suddenly and develops high blood pressure compared to primary hypertension. Various conditions result in secondary hypertension: </p>
<p>•<strong> Kidney diseases</strong></p>
<p><strong>• Thyroid problems</strong></p>
<p><strong> • Adrenal gland tumors </strong></p>
<p><strong>• Medications, over-the-counter pain relievers, and prescription drugs </strong></p>
<p><strong>• Illegal drugs such as amphetamines and cocaine </strong></p>
<h3>What Are The Causes Of Hypertension ?</h3>
<p> The causes of hypertension are not as known. Sometimes mild causes lead to hypertension (primary), and sometimes major causes lead to hypertension (secondary). </p>
<p>Some of the causes of hypertension are: </p>
<p><strong>• High salt intake </strong></p>
<p><strong>• Excessive alcohol intake </strong></p>
<p><strong>• Having a sedentary lifestyle </strong></p>
<p><strong>• Smoking • Having obesity </strong></p>
<p><strong>• Insulin resistance </strong></p>
<p><strong>• Pregnancy </strong></p>
<p><strong>• Hyperparathyroidism, which influences the phosphorus and calcium level </strong></p>
<p><strong>• Cushing's syndrome </strong></p>
<p><strong>• Diabetes, due to nerve damage or kidney problems. </strong></p>
<p><strong>• Hyperthyroidism, or an overactive thyroid gland </strong></p>
<h3>What's Your Blood Pressure Reading ?</h3>
<p> A physician will place an inflatable cuff around your arm to take a blood pressure reading and inflate it until the blood flow is halted. The cuff will then be slowly deflated until a blood rush is heard through one of the arteries in your arm. The upper number in the blood pressure (BP) measurement represents the systolic blood pressure, so this number should be recorded first, followed by the lower number for the diastolic blood pressure. </p>
<p><strong>• How do we measure blood pressure? Different numbers represent the relative health of your blood pressure. </strong></p>
<p><strong>• Blood pressure below 120/80mmHg is considered normal, though this is sometimes referred to as "120 over 80". </strong></p>
<p><strong>• Between 120/80 or 139/89 mmHg is a "prehypertension" stage, in which the presence of high blood pressure (hypertension) can be detected but not confirmed. </strong></p>
<p><strong>• Between 140 over 90 and 180 over 110 mmHg is considered hypertension, which always indicates a pathological condition. Your healthcare provider will perform three measurements over time and begin medication therapy if needed. </strong></p>
<h3>How Can You Diagnose Hypertension ?</h3>
<p><strong> To diagnose hypertension, the doctor will recommend you the following tests: </strong></p>
<h2>Echocardiogram:</h2>
<p> In an echocardiogram, ultrasound waves are used to get the images of valves and chambers of the heart to study the heart's pumping action. It is also used to measure the chambers and wall thickness of the heart. </p>
<h2>Electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG):</h2>
<p> The electrocardiogram or ECG tests the electrical activity, rhythm, and heartbeat rate through electrodes attached to the arms, legs, and chest. The consequences of ECG appear on the graph. </p>
<h2>When Do You Need To See A Doctor ?</h2>
<p> You have to check your blood pressure regularly as a routine check-up. You should check your blood pressure from both arms to diagnose if there's a difference. If you have already been suffering from hypertension or cardiovascular disorders, doctors will suggest more recurrent readings of measuring blood pressure. The consequences of hypertension are not severe, and it can be treated by yourself by following home remedies and changing lifestyles.</p>
<p> But sometimes, the situation is not normal, and the patients experience lethal conditions such as difficulty breathing, intense chest pain, unbearable headache, etc. This may lead to syndromes that can even cause death. In that situation, it is necessary to examine the condition of patients by doctors. Simple home remedies cannot treat this. Doctors prescribed medications that must be followed to maintain blood pressure. </p>
<h3>Risk Factors:</h3>
<p><strong> Risk factors of hypertension include: </strong></p>
<h2>Being Overweight:</h2>
<p> If you are overweight, more blood you would need to supply nutrients and oxygen to your tissues. And as the amount of blood flow through your vessels increases, the pressure on your artery walls will also increase considerably. </p>
<h2>Smoking:</h2>
<p> Veins and arteries can be damaged by smoking tobacco or being exposed to secondhand smoke. Consequently, hypertension might occur. </p>
<h2>Age:</h2>
<p> You are more likely to acquire hypertension by age. Hypertension is more common in men of age 60 or more. Women are more likely to have hypertension at the age of 65 or more. </p>
<h2>Family History:</h2>
<p> Hypertension tends to run in families (generation after generation). </p>
<h2>Depression Or Stress: </h2>
<p> Too much stress develops an emergency in the body, which results in elevated blood pressure to its peak. </p>
<h2>Chronic Condition: </h2>
<p> Diabetes, kidney diseases, sleep apnea, thyroid problems, and the use of harmful drugs can cause hypertension. </p>
<h2>Drinking too much alcohol: </h2>
<p> Heavy drinking can destroy your heart. For men, more than two drinks, and for women, more than one drink per day badly influences the blood pressure because one drink of alcohol equals 12 ounces of beer, 5 ounces of wine, and 1.5 ounces of 80 proof liquor. </p>
<h3>Home Remedies to cure hypertension : </h3>
<p><strong> You can stabilize your blood pressure value by following these remedies regularly: </strong></p>
<h2>Intake of Salt: </h2>
<p> It is essential to reduce sodium intake if you are suffering from hypertension. Read the food labels to check the salt quantity in them. Contact your doctor and ask him what should be the daily sodium limit. </p>
<h2>Healthy Body Weight: </h2>
<p> As mentioned above, obesity leads to hypertension. If you do not know what should be the ideal weight, concern your doctor. He will guide you according to your body mass index (BMI). </p>
<h2>Workout or Physical Activity: </h2>
<p> Exercise for about 30 to 40 minutes assists you in stabilizing the overall circulation of blood so that your blood pressure remains normal. </p>
<h2>Prevent Alcohol and Smoking: </h2>
<p> Make sure that your meal should be alcohol-free. And also, avoid smoking (both active and passive) as they lead to hypertension. </p>
<h2>Avoid Stress or Depression: </h2>
<p> One of the primary reasons people acquire variation in blood pressure value is anxiety, depression, or stress. Therefore, try to prevent stress and make your body relax, and live your life fully! </p>
