<h3>Blood Pressure </h3>
<p>When the heart pumps blood, a specific force is applied that pushes the blood against the walls of arteries. This exerted force against the walls of arteries is called blood pressure. Blood pressure is clinically measured by an instrument called a Sphygmomanometer. </p>
<p> A Sphygmomanometer has a blood pressure cuff that is fastened around the arm and tightens gradually to measure blood pressure. As a result of this measurement, two values are obtained. The first one is systolic blood pressure, and the second one is diastolic blood pressure. A Sphygmomanometer measures the blood pressure in the units of millimeter mercury as mmHg. </p>
<h2>Systolic Blood Pressure :</h2>
<p> Heartbeat causes the movement and squeezing of blood via arteries to the rest of the body. This leads to the exertion of pressure on the blood vessel. This pressure is named systolic blood pressure. The range of systolic blood pressure is given below : </p>
<p><strong>Normal:</strong> Below 120 mmHg </p>
<p><strong>Elevated:</strong> 120 to 129 mmHg </p>
<p><strong>Hypertension:</strong> 130 to 139 mmHg </p>
<p><strong>Stage 2 hypertension:</strong> 140 mmHg or above </p>
<p><strong>Hypertensive crisis:</strong> 180 mmHg or above </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Classification of Blood Pressure: </h3>
<p> The American Heart Association recognizes five major categories. The detail of each category is given below: </p>
<h2>Normal Blood Pressure: </h2>
<p> Blood pressure less than 120/80 mm Hg is taken as normal. If your blood pressure value falls under this category, then take a balanced diet with regular exercises to maintain this value. </p>
<h2>Elevated Blood Pressure: </h2>
<p> When the systolic reading is 120 to 129 mmHg, and diastolic is below 80 mm Hg, it is considered elevated blood pressure. People having elevated BP are likely to adopt high blood pressure diseases. Therefore it is needed to take precautionary steps to control the condition. </p>
<h2>Hypertension Stage 1: </h2>
<p> When the systolic value is 130 to 139 mmHg, and diastolic is 80 to 89 mm Hg, it is referred to as hypertension stage 1. Doctors recommend changing the lifestyle and adding medication to prevent atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases (ASCVD) like stroke or heart attack. </p>
<h2>Hypertension Stage 2:</h2>
<p> When the blood pressure range is 140/90 mmHg or more, it is considered hypertension stage 2. At this stage, doctors suggest taking a proper diet with some medication. </p>
<h2>Hypertensive crises:</h2>
<p> If your blood pressure value reaches 180/120 mmHg or above, it is a hypertensive crisis. This stage requires serious medical attention. If the person is experiencing chest pain, numbness, shortness of breath, vision change, or difficulty talking, do not wait and concern the doctor. </p>
<h2>Whether Systolic Value Is Important Or Diastolic Value?</h2>
<p> Typically, the systolic blood pressure value is considered more significant because its elevation causes cardiovascular (CV) diseases, especially for people over 50. Mostly, systolic blood pressure rises persistently due to increasing tightness of large arteries, increased incidence of cardiac and vascular conditions, and long-term build-up of plaque. </p>
<p>To diagnose high blood pressure, both systolic and diastolic values matter. Latest studies revealed that death risk from stroke and heart diseases doubles with every 20 mm Hg systolic increase in Blood Pressure among 40 to 89 age. </p>
<h2>How Can You Control High Blood Pressure?</h2>
<p> If you are experiencing high blood pressure like issues, then you can control them by following ways: </p>
<h2>Lose weight:</h2>
<p> If you are overweight, lose your body fat to maintain a normal blood pressure value. Excess body weight makes your heart push blood faster and stronger so that each tissue can be perfused. This can contribute to high blood pressure in overweight people. Lean body mass will make it easy for your heart to supply each organ effectively. </p>
<h2>Regular Exercise:</h2>
<p> Studies have shown that aerobic exercise of about 40 minutes for 3 to 4 weeks makes your heart beat faster. It improves your blood circulation. Cardio exercises make your heart muscle strong so that the heart muscles are better able to withhold blood pressure. </p>
<h2>Intake of sodium chloride (table salt):</h2>
<p> Consume less amount of table salt if you are suffering from high blood pressure. Sodium being osmotic increases the oncotic plasma pressure. Please consult your doctor and ask him about your daily sodium usage and follow a properly balanced diet schedule. </p>

<h2>Restrict sugars:</h2>
<p> Studies have suggested that sugar intake, especially fructose, can markedly increase blood pressure. Fructose is better metabolized by the human body and makes glucose readily available, which results in hyperglycemia (high blood sugar level). Reducing the sugar content in your diet can help you control high blood pressure. </p>
	<h3>Steps to Prevent Hypertension (high blood pressure): </h3>
<p><strong> The first line strategy to prevent high blood pressure is to modify your lifestyle by adopting healthy habits. Following are some things you should avoid: </strong></p>
<h2>Quit Smoking:</h2>
<p> "Smoking is injurious to health" is the most-hearing tagline all over the world, is a fact now. Smoking affects multiple organs in your body and brings metabolic changes to the body. The chemicals present in cigarettes can induce inflammation in the blood vessels. The rest of the damage is done by the inflammatory mediators that increase the blood pressure. </p>
<h2>Avoid Junk Food:</h2>
<p> Almost all fast food has the potential to raise blood pressure by its high salt and carbohydrate content. You should avoid these junk foods for your better health. </p>
<h2>Less Stress, Strong Heart:</h2>
<p> Stress activates the sympathetic response of the body and hence increases heart rate and blood pressure. Studies suggest that people who don't take much stress have better compliance for diseases like hypertension. You can reduce your stress by adopting hobbies like book reading, gardening, running, etc. </p>
<h2>Get a Restful Sleep:</h2>
<p> Restful sleep slows down the metabolism and also heart rate. During sleep, the only vital function of the body is the blood supply to vital organs. It makes less pushing of the vessels resulting in decreased blood pressure. People who cannot get proper sleep are more prone to hypertension and anxiety disorders. </p>
